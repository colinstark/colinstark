# Hi there, I'm Colin 👋
I'm a UX designer and engineer living in Wiesbaden, Germany. 

Before working in an agency, I was a freelance web designer & developer, where I taught myself CSS, Javascript and Ruby On Rails. Due to its popularity within the Rails community, I also fell in love with SASS ❤️

I'm always fascinated by how the things we use everyday work, and love modern technologies – currently I'm working on a new project that will improve the way artists and music labels commmunicate (building the app with React and Firebase), and build apps with my friends at Big Eazy.


🌱 I’m currently learning mongodb (w. realm)

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on awesome new stuff. drop me a dm :)
