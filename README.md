# Hi there, I'm Colin ðŸ‘‹
I'm a UX designer and developer living in Barcelona, Spain. 

I'm always fascinated by how the things we use everyday work, and love modern technologies â€“ currently I'm working on a new project that will improve the way artists and music labels commmunicate.


ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning elixir & phoenix.
