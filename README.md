# Hi there, I'm Colin 👋
I'm a UX designer and engineer living in Barcelona, Spain. 

I'm always fascinated by how the things we use everyday work, and love modern technologies – currently I'm working on a new project that will improve the way artists and music labels commmunicate.


🌱 I’m currently learning elixir.
